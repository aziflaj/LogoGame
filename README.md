# README

This is a Logo Game built with [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/). This application is a rewrite of an older application from a SitePoint article ([part 1](http://www.sitepoint.com/firefox-os-game-development-ionic-framework/) and [part 2](http://www.sitepoint.com/firefox-os-game-development-ionic-framework-part-2/)). You can find the original source code [here](https://github.com/aziflaj/yalg).

I rewrote the application for 3 reasons:

1. I had completely lost track with Ionic and what [Drifty](https://github.com/driftyco/) has been doing lately. I wanted to retry the framework and check the latest features they added.
2. While Angular2 is in progress, so is Ionic2. So I rewrote this, using the awesome [Angular style guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide) by [John Papa](https://twitter.com/john_papa), and later will compare this to the newer Ionic2 framework.
3. I want to try to integrate [ngCordova](http://ngcordova.com/) with this application, firstly for the embedded SQLite database and maybe later for other things too.
